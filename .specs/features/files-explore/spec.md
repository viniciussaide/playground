# Files Direction — Explore (F1) Specification

## Epic Context

This is **F1 of 5** of the Files epic, grilled as one design tree and specified slice by slice
(the AD-006 precedent for the Workflows epic). Decisions that belong to later slices are recorded
here so they survive until those slices are specified.

| Slice | Feature folder (planned) | Delivers | Decisions it inherits |
| ----- | ------------------------ | -------- | --------------------- |
| **F1** | `files-explore` (this spec) | The Files direction: mode selector, file tree, read-only tabbed viewer, launchers, `.sln` → VS 2026 | — |
| F2 | `files-diff` | A click in the two diff modes opens a diff instead of the file; a total diff of every file stacked and collapsible | Base = merge-base with `origin/HEAD`, switchable by a picker. Side by side by default, toggle to inline |
| F3 | `files-commits` | The branch's commits since that base; a click opens that commit's diff in the F2 viewer | Scope is "since the base", not the full log |
| F4 | `files-pr-ado` | The current branch's Azure DevOps PR and its threads (P1); reply, resolve/reopen, a new thread on a text selection, a general PR comment (P2) | The PR is found by searching **every** remote for one whose head is this branch (fork → upstream included). A new thread can only be started from a view rendering the **PR's own head version**, fetched from the provider, so the selected line is the line reviewers see. **Breaks the README's "ADO integration is view-only" posture — record an AD when F4 is specified** |
| F5 | `files-pr-github` | The same over GitHub | Introduces a minimal `GitHubGateway` (token from `gh auth token`, no stored secret) designed for issue #50 to extend. A `gh` chip joins the TopBar's `az` chip, shown only when a registered repo has a GitHub remote, checked on window focus |

## Problem Statement

The app knows every worktree and opens it in five external tools, but it cannot show you what is
inside one. To look at a file an agent just wrote, you open VS Code or Explorer; to see which files
changed, you read `git status` in a terminal. The status bar (`status-bar`) will count the changed
files and list them, but it has nowhere to send you.

F1 adds a Files direction: browse the selected worktree's files through three lenses, read any of
them in tabs without leaving the app, and hand one off to the right external tool.

## Goals

- [ ] The selected worktree's files are browsable inside the app, respecting `.gitignore`
- [ ] Three lenses over the same tree: everything, what the branch changed since its base, what is uncommitted
- [ ] Any text file reads in a tab with syntax highlighting, and stays current while an agent edits it
- [ ] Every file or folder is one click from Explorer, VS Code, VS 2022 and VS 2026; a solution opens in VS 2026
- [ ] The status bar's changed-file counter lands here

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
| ------- | ------ |
| Any diff rendering | F2. Until then the two diff modes open the file's current content (FXPL-14) |
| Commit list | F3 |
| Pull requests and comments | F4 (Azure DevOps), F5 (GitHub) |
| Editing, saving, or any write to a file | Owner decision (grill Q2): read-only. The worktrees are where agents write; the app does not compete with them. Editing is handed off by the launchers |
| Search or filter within the tree | Not requested; the modes are the filter |
| VS Code-style preview (transient) tabs | Every open is a real tab; a preview model can come later |
| Tabs persisting across app restarts | Owner decision (grill Q16): a restored tab for a file an agent has since deleted is the failure being avoided |
| A Windows Terminal launcher under the tabs | The owner listed Explorer, VS 2022, VS 2026 and VS Code; the terminal is one click away in the Tree direction |
| Showing ignored files | Owner decision (grill Q7): the tree is what git would track |
| Rendering images or other binary content | Owner decision (grill Q18): placeholder plus the launchers |

---

## Assumptions & Open Questions

| Assumption / decision | Chosen default | Rationale | Confirmed? |
| --------------------- | -------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Where it lives | A sixth direction, `files`, in the TopBar segment control and in `AppConfig.ui.direction` | The app's existing navigation pattern (`config.ts:66`) | y |
| Which worktree it describes | The global tree selection (`selectedId`) | Same selection the Tree direction and the status bar use | y |
| "Full folder" listing | `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`, expanded folder by folder | Tracked plus untracked-not-ignored is exactly "what git would track"; `node_modules`, `bin`, `obj` drop out with no rule of the app's own | y |
| "Uncommitted changes" listing | `worktrees:changes` (`changedFilesOf`), five statuses | Already built and already the status bar's source; staged, unstaged and untracked all count | y |
| "Diff to origin" listing | Files changed on the branch since `merge-base(HEAD, <base>)`, committed changes only | What a PR shows; uncommitted work has its own mode. Base default `origin/HEAD`, switchable (grill Q4) | y |
| No `origin/HEAD` | The base picker opens empty with a prompt to choose a base; the mode lists nothing until one is chosen | The app does not persist a worktree's base branch (verified), so it must never guess one silently | y |
| Mode memory | Per worktree, persisted in `AppConfig.ui` beside the other UI state; first visit = full folder; arriving from the status bar forces "uncommitted" | Owner decision (grill Q15, Q8) | y |
| Tab lifetime | Per worktree, in memory, until the app closes | Owner decision (grill Q16) | y |
| A click in a diff mode, before F2 | Opens the file's current content with a label saying the diff arrives later | Owner decision (grill Q21): all three modes ship now and the counter has somewhere to land | y |
| A deleted file clicked in a diff mode | A placeholder saying the file was deleted, not an error | There is no current content to open, and until F2 no diff to show | y |
| Launcher target | The active tab's file; when a folder was selected more recently, that folder | "Open this file or folder in them" (owner's wording) | y |
| Explorer on a file | `explorer.exe /select,<path>` — shows the file in its folder | `explorer.exe <file>` **opens** the file in its default app (`shortcut-launcher.ts:56`) | y |
| Visual Studio launches | Elevated, as every VS launch already is (AD-016) — a UAC prompt per launch | Owner decision (grill Q22): one VS instance with one privilege level; mixing elevated and non-elevated opens two windows | y |
| `.sln` / `.slnx` click | Opens in VS 2026 instead of a tab | Owner's specification | y |
| Binary or large files | Not rendered above ~1 MB or when binary; the tab shows name, size and type plus the launchers | Owner decision (grill Q18) | y |
| Freshness | One recursive watch on the selected worktree's root, debounced; a change refreshes only the open tabs and the current mode's list, keeping scroll position | Owner decision (grill Q20, design D2): agents write to these files constantly. A new untracked file is only visible by watching the folder; reacting to everything would not be affordable, so the reaction — not the watch — is what is scoped | y |
| Viewer component | Decided at Design (Monaco, CodeMirror or own rendering) | A technical choice, like status-bar D1–D4; the spec fixes behaviour only | y |
| Branch base | `feature/files-explore` stacked on `feature/status-bar` | FXPL-31 changes the status bar's counter; per the fork workflow a dependent feature branches from its dependency | y |
| Amendment to `status-bar` | FXPL-31 supersedes STBR-30's popover and STBR-32's "no action" once F1 lands | Owner decision (grill Q8); the popover was always the counter's stand-in | y |

**Open questions:** none — all resolved or logged above.

## User Stories

### P1: Browse the worktree ⭐ MVP

**User Story**: As the developer, I want a Files direction showing the selected worktree's files as
a tree, so that I can see what is in a worktree without opening another tool.

**Why P1**: Everything else in the epic hangs off this surface.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. The TopBar SHALL offer a sixth direction, `Files`, and the chosen direction SHALL persist like the other five <!-- ubiquitous -->
2. WHILE the Files direction is active with a worktree selected the view SHALL show that worktree's files as a tree in a left column <!-- state-driven -->
3. WHILE no worktree is selected the Files direction SHALL show an empty state asking for a selection <!-- state-driven -->
4. The full-folder tree SHALL list tracked files and untracked files that `.gitignore` does not exclude, and no ignored file <!-- ubiquitous -->
5. WHEN the user expands a folder THEN the view SHALL load that folder's children only, not the whole tree <!-- event-driven -->
6. WHEN the tree selection changes to another worktree THEN the view SHALL show that worktree's tree, mode and tabs <!-- event-driven -->

**Independent Test**: Select a worktree containing `node_modules` and an untracked non-ignored file; Files lists the untracked file, omits `node_modules`, and expanding a folder loads only its children.

---

### P1: Switch the lens ⭐ MVP

**User Story**: As the developer, I want to switch the tree between the whole folder, what my
branch changed, and what I have not committed, so that I look at exactly the files that matter now.

**Why P1**: The modes are what make the tree useful on a branch under review or under an agent.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

7. The left column SHALL carry a mode selector at its top with three modes: full folder, diff to origin, uncommitted changes <!-- ubiquitous -->
8. WHILE in diff-to-origin mode the tree SHALL list only files changed between `merge-base(HEAD, <base>)` and `HEAD` <!-- state-driven -->
9. WHILE in diff-to-origin mode the view SHALL show the base in use and let the user switch it to another branch <!-- state-driven -->
10. WHERE the repository has an `origin/HEAD` the base SHALL default to it <!-- optional-feature -->
11. IF the repository has no `origin/HEAD` THEN the base picker SHALL ask the user to choose a base and the mode SHALL list nothing until one is chosen <!-- unwanted-behavior -->
12. WHILE in uncommitted-changes mode the tree SHALL list exactly the paths `worktrees:changes` returns, each with its change status <!-- state-driven -->
13. WHEN the user returns to a worktree THEN the view SHALL restore the mode last used for it, persisted across restarts, defaulting to full folder <!-- event-driven -->
14. WHILE F2 has not shipped, WHEN the user opens a file from either diff mode THEN the view SHALL show its current content labelled as a file view, not a diff <!-- complex -->
15. IF the user opens a file listed as deleted THEN the view SHALL show a placeholder stating the file was deleted <!-- unwanted-behavior -->

**Independent Test**: On a branch two commits past `main` with one uncommitted edit, the diff mode lists the committed files, the uncommitted mode lists the edited one with `modified`, and switching worktrees and back restores the last mode.

---

### P1: Read files in tabs ⭐ MVP

**User Story**: As the developer, I want to open files in tabs with syntax highlighting and see
them update as an agent writes, so that I can follow the work without leaving the app.

**Why P1**: Reading is the point of opening a file here instead of in VS Code.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

16. WHEN the user clicks a file in the tree THEN the view SHALL open it in a tab in the right column, or focus its tab when already open <!-- event-driven -->
17. The viewer SHALL be read-only and render text with syntax highlighting for the file's language <!-- ubiquitous -->
18. The system SHALL keep each worktree's open tabs while the app runs and SHALL NOT restore tabs after a restart <!-- ubiquitous -->
19. WHEN the user closes a tab THEN the view SHALL focus the adjacent tab, or show an empty state when none is left <!-- event-driven -->
20. IF a file is binary or larger than 1 MB THEN its tab SHALL show the file's name, size and type and the launchers, and SHALL NOT render its content <!-- unwanted-behavior -->
21. WHEN an open file changes on disk THEN its tab SHALL update in place within 1 s and keep its scroll position <!-- event-driven -->
22. WHEN a file in the current mode's list is added, changed or removed on disk THEN the tree SHALL reflect it within 1 s <!-- event-driven -->
23. The system SHALL watch only the selected worktree, SHALL react to a disk change only by refreshing that worktree's open tabs and current mode list, and SHALL stop watching a worktree once it is no longer selected <!-- ubiquitous -->
24. IF an open file is deleted on disk THEN its tab SHALL stay open showing a placeholder that the file no longer exists <!-- unwanted-behavior -->

**Independent Test**: Open a file, have a shell append a line to it, and watch the tab update within a second without jumping to the top; delete the file and see the tab switch to its placeholder.

---

### P1: Hand off to the right tool ⭐ MVP

**User Story**: As the developer, I want a row of launchers under the tabs that opens the current
file or folder in Explorer, VS Code, VS 2022 or VS 2026, and a solution to open straight in VS 2026,
so that editing is one click away.

**Why P1**: Read-only is only acceptable because editing is one click away.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

25. The right column SHALL show, under the tabs, launchers for File Explorer, VS Code, VS 2022 and VS 2026 <!-- ubiquitous -->
26. WHEN the user activates a launcher THEN the system SHALL open the launcher's tool on the active tab's file, or on the folder most recently selected in the tree when that selection is newer <!-- event-driven -->
27. WHEN File Explorer is launched on a file THEN it SHALL open the file's folder with the file selected, never open the file itself <!-- event-driven -->
28. WHEN the user clicks a `.sln` or `.slnx` file in the tree THEN the system SHALL open it in VS 2026 instead of opening a tab <!-- event-driven -->
29. Visual Studio launches SHALL keep the elevated behaviour every VS launch already has (AD-016) <!-- ubiquitous -->
30. IF a launch fails THEN the view SHALL show the launcher's existing failure toast <!-- unwanted-behavior -->

**Independent Test**: Open a `.cs` file and launch Explorer: the folder opens with the file highlighted. Click the repo's `.sln`: VS 2026 opens it after the UAC prompt and no tab appears.

---

### P2: Arrive from the status bar

**User Story**: As the developer, I want the status bar's changed-file counter to take me to Files
showing my uncommitted changes, so that the counter leads somewhere useful.

**Why P2**: It depends on `status-bar` landing first, and F1 is useful without it.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

31. WHEN the user activates the status bar's changed-file counter THEN the app SHALL switch to the Files direction on that worktree in uncommitted-changes mode, superseding STBR-30's popover and STBR-32 <!-- event-driven -->
32. WHEN the Files direction is entered from the counter THEN the forced mode SHALL be remembered as that worktree's last mode <!-- event-driven -->

**Independent Test**: Dirty a worktree, click the counter from the Board direction, and land in Files in uncommitted mode listing the dirty file.

---

## Edge Cases

- IF the selected worktree's path no longer exists THEN the Files direction SHALL show the path-missing state the tree already derives, with no tree and no tabs
- IF `git ls-files` fails for the worktree THEN the tree SHALL show git's first error line instead of an empty tree
- WHEN a base branch chosen in the picker is later deleted THEN the diff mode SHALL fall back to the prompt of FXPL-11
- WHEN a file is renamed by an agent while open THEN the old tab SHALL show the deleted placeholder (FXPL-24) and the new path SHALL appear in the tree
- WHEN the same file is open in two worktrees THEN each worktree's tab SHALL be independent
- IF a text file's encoding is not UTF-8 THEN the viewer SHALL render it as UTF-8 with replacement characters rather than refuse to open it

## Success Criteria

- [ ] A worktree's files are browsable in all three modes, and `node_modules` never appears
- [ ] A file an agent is writing updates in its tab within a second, without losing scroll position
- [ ] Any file or folder reaches Explorer (selected, not opened), VS Code, VS 2022 or VS 2026 in one click; a `.sln` opens in VS 2026 directly
- [ ] A 200 MB log or a DLL never freezes the viewer
- [ ] The status bar's counter lands in Files on the uncommitted changes
- [ ] The gate is green: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test`
