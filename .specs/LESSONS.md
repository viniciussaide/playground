## Confirmed (load these at Specify/Design)

Corroborated across multiple features. Safe to apply as guidance.

### L-001 - When a design types a cross-phase dependency as required, wire the producer and consumer in one phase (or gate the field) rather than relaxing it to optional to keep an interim phase's typecheck green
- signal: `spec_deviation` · recurrence: 2 feature(s) · scope: `workflow-ctx` · harmful: 0
- features: workflows-agent-step, workflows-blocker-resume
- evidence: src/main/workflow-ctx.ts:82,106 (CtxDeps.agent / CtxRuntime.signal SPEC_DEVIATION) (workflow-ctx) (+1 more)
- last seen: 2026-07-06T16:15:40Z

### L-005 - Before adding real-process or real-git tests, check whether existing suites already sit near the default per-test timeout: the extra parallel load alone can push them over it, turning a green gate red without any production change
- signal: `gate_fail` · recurrence: 2 feature(s) · scope: `testing` · harmful: 0
- features: worktree-post-create-hook, worktree-removal-fault-tolerance
- evidence: validation.md round-2 gate section; tree.test.ts / worktree-manager.test.ts timeouts (testing) (+1 more)
- last seen: 2026-07-31T12:27:40Z

### L-009 - A default-constant test that asserts resolvePaneWidth(undefined, bounds, DEFAULT) against DEFAULT itself cannot detect a change to that constant — pin every spec-derived default with a literal assertion, not a self-referential one.

## Candidates (under observation - do NOT load as guidance yet)

Seen once or not yet corroborated. Tracked, not trusted.

### L-008 - When a hard-coded value becomes a lookup table keyed by an existing enum, test the wiring from key to entry, not just the table: asserting the table's contents leaves the new key free to silently resolve to the old entry, and a guard that returns before any side effect (a missing-path check) usually makes that routing assertable without touching the real subsystem.

### L-010 - When a spec edge case says 'empty/whitespace', guard with trim().length > 0, not length > 0, or whitespace-only selections slip past the empty check.
- signal: `spec_precision_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `src/renderer/src/components` · harmful: 0

- evidence: src/renderer/src/components/TerminalPane.tsx:95 (src/renderer/src/components)
- last seen: 2026-09-01T00:11:37Z

### L-011 - When an AC names a literal byte or string the app must emit, export that literal as a const from the tested lib seam and assert it (plus assert it is NOT the wrong value) - a literal inlined in an untested component leaves a NOT-SHALL-send AC unguarded and a byte flip passes the whole suite.

### L-012 - Under a no-component-tests convention, push every AC-bearing decision (timestamp restart, trim threshold, preventDefault ordering) into the pure lib function and leave only DOM/clipboard calls in the component - state left in the component is verifiable by reading only and regresses silently.

- last seen: 2026-09-09T21:51:28Z

### L-013 - An AC that starts a timer 'WHEN the app copies X' must state explicitly whether an attempted copy of nothing also starts it - the implementation set the timestamp before the empty-selection guard, a behavior no AC covers and no test can flag.

### L-014 - Freeze a design region by naming the components that are unchanged, never by a CSS or source line range, because a line range silently over-freezes neighbouring rules the handoff re-specified.

### L-015 - When one acceptance criterion refers to a label another criterion already pins, cite that criterion instead of paraphrasing it, because a paraphrase drifts and the two criteria then disagree.

### L-016 - Do not type a clickable row that contains its own action buttons as a <button>; use a div with role="option" plus tabIndex and key handling, because a button nested in a button is invalid HTML.

- last seen: 2026-09-13T16:05:00Z

### L-017 - Assert a reset-to-zero effect from a state that actually holds a non-zero value: a test that drives the event from an already-zero state passes whether or not the reset happens

### L-018 - When an AC lands in a layer the project exempts from unit tests, extract the decision into a lib module and test that, rather than deferring the evidence to a smoke script that has not been written yet
- signal: `ac_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `renderer` · harmful: 0

### L-019 - Pin a spec-mandated numeric limit with a literal assertion on the default production uses; a test that overrides the value to run fast leaves the default free to drift.

### L-020 - When an AC mandates an environment variable or spawn option for a child process, assert it from inside the spawned process or on the spawn call; testing the wrapper's outcomes never observes it.

### L-021 - When a task names a smoke script as the sole evidence for an AC, confirm the script has a numbered check asserting that AC before marking it done; listing the requirement ID is not a check.
- signal: `ac_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `scripts/smoke` · harmful: 0

### L-022 - Before an edge case cites a state the app already derives, confirm the model carries it at that level; otherwise name the state the feature must add.

### L-023 - Git pull and push write progress and hint lines to stderr before the error, so report the first fatal or error line rather than the first stderr line.

### L-024 - When an error extractor accepts several prefixes, drive a real failure for each prefix; testing only one leaves the others, and flags that turn the refusal into success, free to change unseen.

### L-025 - Map every spec edge case to its own test or numbered smoke check in tasks.md, as ACs are; edge cases left to structure or to the tool's own behaviour reach validation with no evidence.

### L-027 - A rejection fixture must reach the guard it claims to test: a wrong-shape input that is also the wrong length dies on the length check, leaving the real guard unproven.

### L-118 - When stale async results are dropped by a generation counter, test leaving and returning to the same target while the async step is held; a plain deselect is caught by the target check and leaves the counter untested.

### L-119 - When an AC requires the same flags on every git call of a module, route each call through an injectable runner and assert its args; calls made straight to the git helper stay unasserted.
- signal: `surviving_mutant` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `git-reads` · harmful: 0

### L-120 - When a fallback AC says a batch passes as it would without a filter, state whether answers cached before the failure still apply, and pin that reading with a test that starts from a non-empty cache.
- signal: `spec_precision_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `specs` · harmful: 0

- last seen: 2026-10-03T23:00:09Z

### L-121 - A code read is not evidence for an AC: give each AC a test, a numbered smoke check or a named run, and list any AC left to reading as a gap in the plan's evidence split.

### L-122 - With a fake clock, a check that nothing more runs must advance past the earliest instant that run could start, re-derived whenever the timing rule changes; a window that ends before it cannot fail

### L-123 - When a rate target is measured at process start but enforced by a scheduler upstream of a shared spawn queue, count the spacing from the previous run's end, because queue waits shrink the gap between the real process starts

### L-124 - When a stop or quit criterion says open requests are answered with nothing, state whether a request already taken by an in-flight run counts as open

### L-125 - When a rule quantifies over a collection (every/all), test the mixed case where only some items match, or an every-to-some mutant survives.

### L-126 - An AC that compares against what is on screen must say what counts as on screen when the view shows none of the things it compares.

### L-127 - A lookup AC that depends on local configuration (a tracked remote, a setting) must state the outcome when that configuration is absent.

### L-128 - Before writing a paging edge case for a provider call, check the reference says the call pages; record the finding either way.

- features: files-pr-ado

### L-129 - When a provider model falls back on a null field, give the null its own test case apart from the flag that usually accompanies it.

### L-130 - A de-duplication step needs a fixture that actually contains duplicates, or removing it survives.

### L-131 - Put a renderer-only permission or retry gate in a pure helper so a unit test, not code reading, is its evidence.

### L-132 - Before promising one view across two providers, check each provider's search input: a branch tracks one remote, so a per-remote search can never yield both.
