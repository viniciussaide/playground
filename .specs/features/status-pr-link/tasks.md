# Status PR Link Tasks

## Execution Protocol (MANDATORY -- do not skip)

Implement these tasks with the `tlc-spec-driven` skill: **activate it by name and follow its Execute flow and Critical Rules.** Do not search for skill files by filesystem path. The skill is the source of truth for the full flow (per-task cycle, sub-agent delegation, adequacy review, Verifier, discrimination sensor).

**If the skill cannot be activated, STOP and tell the user - do not proceed without it.**

---

**Design**: inline. Two pure functions decide everything the bar shows — `reviewMark(reviewers)` and `prChip(lookup)`, which turns both providers' search results and details into one of `one`, `many`, `create`, `unknown`, `hidden` — so rendering is a switch. The lookup is lifted out of F4/F5's `usePullRequest` into a shared hook App mounts (T3, T4); see the reconciliation below for why it cannot be used as is.
**Status**: Reconciled against the executed F4/F5 code 2026-10-10 — awaiting owner approval (planned 2026-09-22)

**Branch**: `feature/status-pr-link` off `origin/main` `a170e6b` (F4 and F5 merged upstream 2026-10-10), rebased `--onto origin/main 28adf84`; backup of the original plan branch `backup/status-pr-link-prerebase`.

**Test baseline**: 3122 tests in 141 files (`npx vitest run`), lint 18 warnings, measured 2026-10-10 (the tree of `a170e6b` equals the F5 tip it was measured on).

### Reconciliation with the executed F4/F5 code (2026-10-10)

| Planned | As built | Effect on the plan |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| `PrSearch` kinds `found`, `none`, `no-ado-remote`, `auth`, `detached`, `error` | `src/shared/files.ts`: `found`, `none { createUrlAvailable }`, `no-remote`, `auth`, `detached`, `rate-limited { resetAt }`, `error`; `PrDetailResult` adds `rate-limited` too | T2: `rate-limited` with nothing found is `unknown`, its reason the reset time; `no-remote` and `detached` hide the chip |
| F4's reviewer states | `ReviewerState`: `approved`, `approved-with-suggestions`, `no-vote`, `waiting-for-author`, `rejected`, `changes-requested`, `commented`, `dismissed` | T1: ✕ `rejected`; ⏸ `waiting-for-author`, `changes-requested`; ✓ `approved`, `approved-with-suggestions`; no mark for `no-vote`, `commented`, `dismissed` |
| Both providers may list PRs for one branch | FPRG-07 as amended in F5: a branch lists only the PRs of the provider whose remote it tracks; the other provider answers `none` with `createUrlAvailable: false` or `no-remote` | `many` comes from one provider with several target branches; SPRL-19 still holds when the other provider fails (`auth`, `error`, `rate-limited`) |
| `use-pull-request` may already live above the direction switch | It does — `useFiles` calls it and App always mounts `useFiles` — but it searches only while the Files direction is in Pull request mode, and reads the detail of **one** PR (the only one, or the one picked) | Not usable as is: the bar needs a search on selection in every direction and every found PR's reviewers. T3 extracts the rules, T4 lifts search, details, the pick and the rate-limit memory into `usePrLookup`, which App mounts and both `usePullRequest` and the bar read |
| FPRG-26 | A provider that answered `rate-limited` is not asked again by a reload that happens on its own (focus, after a write), only by one the user asked for | The bar's focus lookups obey the same memory — it lives in the shared hook |
| Openers `ado-pr:open`, `github-pr:open` | As planned: `{ worktreePath, pr }` or `{ worktreePath, create: true }`; main builds the URL | T6 calls them; the failure reason text is F5's `failureText`, exported from the shared rules |
| Bar target | `barTargetFor` in `status-bar.ts`: the tree selection, or in Agents the selected session's worktree; picking a session also picks its worktree in App | The lookup is keyed by worktree path and the bar paints the entry of its own target |
| T7 stub "wrap `window.api.invoke`" | `window.api` is exposed through `contextBridge`, whose copy the page cannot change; the preload's `api.invoke` calls `ipcRenderer.invoke` at call time | T8 stubs `ipcRenderer.invoke` in the preload's isolated world over CDP, for the four lookup channels only; it proves the stub first and stops if it cannot be installed |

## Test Coverage Matrix

> Generated from codebase, project guidelines, and spec — confirm before Execute. Guidelines found: `.specs/codebase/TESTING.md`, `vitest.config.ts`, `package.json` scripts; style sampled from `src/renderer/src/lib/status-bar.test.ts` and `pr-view.test.ts`. The repository tests no hook directly; hook decisions live in pure modules that are tested.

| Code Layer | Required Test Type | Coverage Expectation | Location Pattern | Run Command |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Pure chip logic (`pr-status.ts`) | unit | 1:1 to SPRL-03..08, 12, 15–19 and the failed-`get` edge case, for both providers' reviewer states | `src/renderer/src/lib/pr-status.test.ts` | `npm test` |
| Pure lookup rules (`pr-lookup.ts`) | unit | Which providers are asked (FPRG-26 memory), which PRs are read, how an answer lands in the per-worktree entry (stale ticket dropped, other worktree cached), the failure text | `src/renderer/src/lib/pr-lookup.test.ts` | `npm test` |
| Lookup hook and App wiring | none (smoke) | SPRL-01, 02, 09, the stale-answer and shared-lookup edge cases | — | smoke |
| `StatusBar` component and CSS | none (CDP smoke) | SPRL-10–14 | — | smoke |
| End to end, stubbed providers | manual CDP smoke | Every chip kind, rendered from stubbed `find`/`get` answers | `scripts/smoke-status-bar.mjs` | live dev app |
| Pull request mode, regression | manual CDP smoke | F4/F5's read-only sections unchanged after T4 | `scripts/smoke-files-pr-ado.mjs`, `scripts/smoke-files-pr-github.mjs` (read-only) | live dev app |
| End to end, real PR | manual, owner-driven | SPRL-01, 10, 11, 15 against PRs the owner names | — | live dev app |

## Gate Check Commands

| Gate Level | When to Use | Command |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Quick | After a task whose only tests are unit tests | `npm test` |
| Full | After a code task | `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test` |
| Build | Wiring tasks and phase ends | `npx electron-vite build` |
| Manual | T8, T9 | smoke / owner check |

**Lint is judged by exit code AND by warning count** — the count above, diffed at every gate.

## Task Breakdown

### T1: `reviewMark` and the tooltip lines

**What**: `reviewMark(reviewers)` → `'rejected' | 'changes' | 'approved' | null`, the worst mark winning, over `ReviewerState`: `rejected` → `rejected`; `waiting-for-author`, `changes-requested` → `changes`; `approved`, `approved-with-suggestions` → `approved`; `no-vote`, `commented`, `dismissed` add nothing. `reviewLines(reviewers)` → one `"<name>: <state label>"` line per reviewer.
**Where**: `src/renderer/src/lib/pr-status.ts` (new) and its test
**Depends on**: None
**Reuses**: `Reviewer`, `ReviewerState` (`src/shared/files.ts`)
**Requirement**: SPRL-04, SPRL-05, SPRL-06, SPRL-07, SPRL-08

**Tools**:

- MCP: NONE
- Skill: NONE

**Done when**:

- [x] Tests for each mark from Azure DevOps-shaped reviewers (votes, groups, required) and GitHub-shaped ones (`changes-requested`, `commented`, `dismissed`); rejected beats changes beats approved; approved-with-suggestions counts as approved; no votes → `null`; groups and required flags do not change the mark
- [x] Gate check passes: `npm test` (full gate run: typecheck, lint 18 warnings, tests)
- [x] Test count: 3122 + 9 = 3131

**Done** 2026-10-10. The state labels moved from `PrOverview.tsx` into `pr-status.ts` (`REVIEWER_STATES`), so the Overview and the tooltip read one map.

**Tests**: unit
**Gate**: quick

**Commit**: `feat(status-bar): mark a pull request by its reviews`

---

### T2: `prChip`

**What**: `prChip({ searches, details })` — `searches` as `PrSearches`, `details` by `prKey` — → `{ kind: 'one', pr, mark, draft, reviewers } | { kind: 'many', prs, notes } | { kind: 'create', provider } | { kind: 'unknown', reason } | { kind: 'hidden' }`. Reasons and notes use F5's `failureText` (moved to `pr-lookup.ts` by T3, so T2 imports it from `use-pull-request.ts` and T3 moves the import).
**Where**: `src/renderer/src/lib/pr-status.ts`
**Depends on**: T1
**Reuses**: `PrSearch`, `PrDetailResult`, `prKey` (`pr-view.ts`)
**Requirement**: SPRL-03, SPRL-12, SPRL-15, SPRL-16, SPRL-17, SPRL-18, SPRL-19

**Tools**:

- MCP: NONE
- Skill: NONE

**Done when**:

- [x] Tests: one PR from either provider; several from one provider → `many`; one provider failing (`auth`, `error`, `rate-limited`) while the other found → the found PRs with a note; `none` with creation available on one provider → `create` naming it, without on both → `hidden`; `auth`, `error` or `rate-limited` with nothing found → `unknown` carrying the reason; `no-remote` or `detached` on both → `hidden`; nothing searched yet → `hidden`; a PR whose detail failed or is not read yet → no mark and reviewers unknown
- [x] Gate check passes: `npm test`
- [x] Test count: T1 count + the new tests

**Done** 2026-10-10, 3131 + 14 = 3145 tests, lint 18. Shape as built: `prChip(searches, reads)`, items carry `{ pr, review }` with `review` `read` / `failed` / `pending` (draft is `pr.isDraft`). A single PR keeps the other provider's failure in `notes` too, for its tooltip, since one PR has no menu. `failureText` is exported from `use-pull-request.ts` until T3 moves it.

**Tests**: unit
**Gate**: quick

**Commit**: `feat(status-bar): decide what the pull request chip shows`

---

### T3: The lookup's rules, pure

**What**: `src/renderer/src/lib/pr-lookup.ts`: the per-worktree entry (`searches`, the last good detail and the last failure per PR by `prKey`, the pick, the rate-limited providers, a load ticket) and the pure steps over it — which providers a reload asks (FPRG-26: a reload that happens on its own skips a provider that answered `rate-limited`), which PRs it reads (every found PR, plus the one on screen when the search no longer lists it), and how an answer lands (an older ticket is dropped; an answer always lands in its own worktree's entry). `failureText` moves here from `use-pull-request.ts`.
**Where**: `src/renderer/src/lib/pr-lookup.ts` (new) and its test; `use-pull-request.ts` imports `failureText`
**Depends on**: T2
**Reuses**: `load`'s rules in `use-pull-request.ts`, which they replace in T4
**Requirement**: SPRL-01, SPRL-09, the stale-answer edge case

**Tools**:

- MCP: NONE
- Skill: NONE

**Done when**:

- [ ] Tests: a focus reload skips a rate-limited provider and keeps its answer, a user reload asks it again; every found PR is read, plus an on-screen PR no longer listed; an answer with an older ticket changes nothing; an answer for worktree A lands in A's entry while B is selected; a failed read keeps the last good detail beside the failure
- [ ] Gate check passes: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test`

**Tests**: unit
**Gate**: full

**Commit**: `refactor(files): state the pull request lookup's rules as pure functions`

---

### T4: One lookup for the bar and the Pull request mode

**What**: `usePrLookup` (new hook, mounted by App above the direction switch) holds the entries of T3 and runs a lookup — both providers' `find` in parallel, then `get` for every PR to read — on: the bar target changing, window focus (5 s debounce, `FOCUS_RELOAD_MS`), the TopBar Refresh, and on behalf of the Pull request mode (entering it, a pick, its refresh, after a write — `search: false`, the shown PR only). `usePullRequest` drops its own search, detail fetch, pick and rate-limit memory and reads them from `usePrLookup`; it keeps its notice, sides, revision banner and writes. Nothing polls.
**Where**: `src/renderer/src/lib/use-pr-lookup.ts` (new), `use-pull-request.ts`, `use-files.ts`, `App.tsx`
**Depends on**: T3
**Reuses**: `usePullRequest`'s `load`, `findOn`, `getOn`
**Requirement**: SPRL-01, SPRL-02, SPRL-09, the stale-answer and shared-lookup edge cases

**Tools**:

- MCP: NONE
- Skill: NONE

**Done when**:

- [ ] The Pull request mode's own behaviour unchanged: the read-only sections of `smoke-files-pr-ado.mjs` and `smoke-files-pr-github.mjs` pass against the PRs the owner names (T9)
- [ ] With the Files direction in Pull request mode on the bar's worktree, one selection runs one `find` per provider, not two
- [ ] Gate check passes: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test` and `npx electron-vite build`

**Tests**: none
**Gate**: build

**Commit**: `refactor(files): share the pull request lookup above the directions`

---

### T5: Open a PR in the Files direction from outside it

**What**: `openPullRequest(worktreeId, pr)` in App: select the worktree, switch to the Files direction with that worktree's mode set to `pull-request` in one config patch (as `openChangedFiles` does), and set the pick in `usePrLookup` for that worktree.
**Where**: `src/renderer/src/App.tsx`
**Depends on**: T4
**Reuses**: `openChangedFiles`
**Requirement**: SPRL-10, SPRL-13

**Tools**:

- MCP: NONE
- Skill: NONE

**Done when**:

- [ ] Gate check passes: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test` and `npx electron-vite build`

**Tests**: none
**Gate**: build

**Commit**: `feat(files): open a pull request from outside the files direction`

---

### T6: The chip and its menu

**What**: `StatusBar` renders `prChip`'s answer for its target: `PR #<n> · Draft <mark>` with a tooltip (reviewer lines, or that they could not be read) and a ↗; `<n> PRs` with a menu (each item: number, title, target branch, provider, mark; opens in the app; its own ↗; provider notes in the footer; Escape or outside click closes); a muted `Create PR`; a muted `PR ?` with its reason; nothing for `hidden`. ↗ and Create PR call `ado-pr:open` / `github-pr:open`.
**Where**: `src/renderer/src/components/StatusBar.tsx`
**Depends on**: T5
**Reuses**: the bar's popover dismissal (`SyncPopover`)
**Requirement**: SPRL-03, SPRL-08, SPRL-10..18

**Tools**:

- MCP: NONE
- Skill: NONE

**Done when**:

- [ ] Gate check passes: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test`

**Tests**: none
**Gate**: full

**Commit**: `feat(status-bar): show the branch's pull request`

---

### T7: Chip styles

**What**: The chip, its marks (✕ ⏸ ✓ with text labels for screen readers, never colour alone), the muted variants and the menu, in both themes, fitting the bar at its minimum width.
**Where**: `src/renderer/src/components/StatusBar.css`
**Depends on**: T6
**Reuses**: the bar's section and popover styles
**Requirement**: SPRL-03..07, SPRL-15, SPRL-17

**Tools**:

- MCP: NONE
- Skill: NONE

**Done when**:

- [ ] At 1100 px wide the bar does not wrap with a long branch and a `2 PRs` chip
- [ ] Gate check passes: `npm run lint` and `npx electron-vite build`

**Tests**: none
**Gate**: build

**Commit**: `style(status-bar): style the pull request chip`

---

### T8: Smoke — every chip kind, stubbed

**What**: A section in `smoke-status-bar.mjs` that stubs `ipcRenderer.invoke` in the preload's isolated world over CDP for `ado-pr:find`, `ado-pr:get`, `github-pr:find`, `github-pr:get` only, and walks `one` with each mark and draft, `many` with its menu and a provider note, `create`, `unknown` (including `rate-limited`), `hidden`, a stale answer after switching worktree, a focus inside 5 s asking nothing, and the in-app open landing in Pull request mode.
**Where**: `scripts/smoke-status-bar.mjs`
**Depends on**: T7
**Reuses**: the script's temp workspace and restore-in-`finally`
**Requirement**: SPRL-01..18, stale-answer edge case

**Tools**:

- MCP: NONE
- Skill: NONE

**Done when**:

- [ ] The stub is proved installed (a stubbed `find` answer reaches the bar) before any check; the section stops if it cannot be
- [ ] Each check seen failing with its rule broken (mark order inverted; `create` shown without `createUrlAvailable`; stale answer painted), then passing
- [ ] The stub is removed in `finally`; no real provider call is made by this section
- [ ] Gate check passes: `npm run lint` (warning count unchanged)

**Tests**: manual
**Gate**: manual

**Commit**: `test(status-bar): check every pull request chip state`

---

### T9: Owner check against a real PR

**Owner (2026-10-10)**: Azure DevOps: the draft PR in the employer org that F4 used is still open. GitHub: a draft PR opened on this project for the purpose (its creation is a write: go-ahead at that moment).
**What**: With the PRs the owner names at this task, the owner selects their worktree: the chip shows the PR and its mark; the chip opens Pull request mode; ↗ opens the browser; a branch without a PR shows `Create PR` and it opens the creation page. The read-only sections of the F4/F5 smokes run against the same PRs (T4's regression check).
**Where**: `.specs/features/status-pr-link/tasks.md` (result)
**Depends on**: T8
**Reuses**: the F4/F5 smokes' read-only sections
**Requirement**: SPRL-01, SPRL-10, SPRL-11, SPRL-15

**Tools**:

- MCP: NONE
- Skill: NONE

**Done when**:

- [ ] Each step's outcome recorded without PR numbers, titles, org or repository names (public repository)
- [ ] Nothing written to any provider (the chip only reads and opens)

**Tests**: none
**Gate**: manual

**Commit**: `docs(specs): record the owner check of the pull request chip`
