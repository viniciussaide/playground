# Playground

> A Windows desktop app that bridges **Azure DevOps work items** to **git worktrees** — and now hosts your **AI coding agents** right where the code lives.

One window to see every worktree across your registered workspaces, pin the ADO tasks you're working on, spin up task-linked worktrees in a single dialog, launch Explorer / Windows Terminal / VS Code rooted at any worktree, and run embedded agent terminals (Claude / Copilot / Codex / ad-hoc) attributed to the worktree — and, by derivation, the task — they run in.

Built for a solo developer juggling several multi-repo projects with multiple AI coding agents running in parallel on different branches. It hosts nothing itself beyond the agent PTYs — external tools are spawned as child processes.

## Why

Going from "task in ADO" to "worktree on disk with tools open on it" is normally a manual chain of terminal commands, path memorization, and window juggling — with no single overview. Once several agents are running, loose terminal windows make it worse. Playground collapses that into one dashboard.

## Features

**Navigation & worktrees**

- Register workspace folders; auto-discover their git repos and every `git worktree` with live dirty/clean status
- Sidebar **Tree** (workspaces → repos → worktrees) with a detail pane: branch, status pills, copyable path, linked-task card
- Create a worktree (with or without a task) and delete one — guarded: refuses a dirty or primary checkout
- One-click launchers: **File Explorer**, **Windows Terminal**, **VS Code**

**Azure DevOps tasks & start-work**

- Pin tasks by ID or URL; title / type / state fetched live (refresh on focus + manual)
- **Start work**: task → worktree with a branch from a configurable template (`{type}/{id}-{slug}`), editable in the dialog with a live path preview
- The task↔worktree link is **derived from the branch name** (the first standalone multi-digit number) — no shadow state. Task tags appear on worktree rows, cards, and the detail pane
- Auth is strictly via `az account get-access-token` — **no stored secrets**; a graceful "run `az login`" prompt on failure

**Board view**

- A task-centric layout: pinned-task chip strip + a workspace/repo-grouped worktree card grid; clicking a chip highlights its linked worktree cards

**Embedded agent sessions**

- Spawn CLI coding agents (**Claude / Copilot / Codex**) as worktree-rooted embedded terminals — a card rail next to a live `xterm.js` terminal (master-detail)
- Multiple concurrent sessions; attach/detach with ring-buffer scrollback replay; per-session Stop / Respawn / Remove
- Sessions are attributed to their worktree and task; sessions persist as metadata and reload as **stopped** (one-click respawn) — PTYs never survive app quit
- An agent can link its own session to a work item — the same link the task picker sets — so a
  skill that starts from a work item id files the session and its hours under that item without a
  click

```powershell
# From inside a Claude session the app spawned: only there are both variables set
$body = @{ id = 12345; title = 'Example task' } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Method Post -Uri $env:PLAYGROUND_TASK_URL `
  -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $env:PLAYGROUND_ACTIVITY_TOKEN" } `
  -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body
```

`id` is the work item id, a positive integer. `title` is optional: a string of at most 255
characters after trimming, or `null`; a blank title counts as `null`. The call links only the
session whose token it carries, from that instant on, and answers with a status and no body: `204`
linked (linking the same id again moves no time), `400` invalid body, `401` missing or unknown
token, `404` unknown path, `405` not a `POST`, `413` body over 4 KiB. When the variables are absent,
the caller is not in a session the app can link: not Claude Code, not spawned by the app, or
spawned before the app's listener was up.

- Start a session on a **prompt file**: every `~/.playground/prompts/<name>.md` shows up as a
  prompt in the New Session dialog, for any registry agent (**Open prompts folder** creates and
  opens the folder). Each `{{name}}` placeholder becomes a required field in a second step;
  `{{taskId}}`, `{{taskTitle}}`, `{{branch}}` and `{{worktree}}` arrive pre-filled from the
  dialog's selections and stay editable

```markdown
<!-- ~/.playground/prompts/implement.md -->
Implement task #{{taskId}} ({{taskTitle}}) on branch {{branch}} with /tlc-spec-driven.

Focus: {{focus}}
```

The agent starts interactively on the resolved prompt, passed as its last argument after `--`
(`claude <args> -- "<prompt>"`), so a prompt that starts with a Markdown `-` still works.
**Respawn** and **Duplicate** start the agent without it. A resolved prompt over 8000 characters
blocks Spawn, and a file over 16 KiB is listed as broken. The text arrives verbatim, line breaks
included, when the agent command is an executable (as `claude.exe` is); an agent launched
through a `.cmd`/`.bat` shim may receive it cut at the first line break or with `"` removed.

**Throughout**

- Light / dark theme, persisted last-session UI state (direction, selection, theme)
- Per-workspace overrides via `.app/config.json` (branch + worktree-folder templates); global defaults in Settings
- Worktree initialization: a repo's init command runs in every new worktree — from the dialogs
  and from workflows alike. A failing command never costs you the worktree; the exit code and
  output are reported inline. The command can be declared **in the repo** or, to keep a shared
  team repo clean, **in the workspace beside it**

```jsonc
// <workspace>/.app/config.json — outside the repos, keyed by repo folder name
{
  "postCreateCommands": {
    // Runs with cwd = the new worktree. Note the JSON-escaped backslash; the
    // leading ".\" matters because some environments set
    // NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath, which stops a bare "SetupSkills.cmd"
    // from resolving; and "< NUL" feeds EOF to a script ending in `pause`, which
    // would otherwise hang until the 120 s timeout.
    "Code": ".\\SetupSkills.cmd < NUL"
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// <repo>/.app/config.json — checked in, so it travels with the repo
{
  "postCreateCommand": ".\\SetupSkills.cmd"
}
```

**Precedence:** the repo's own `postCreateCommand` wins; the workspace's
`postCreateCommands[<repoName>]` applies only when the repo declares nothing. Exactly one
command ever runs. Keys are per-repo — a repo the map does not name runs nothing — matched
exactly, or case-insensitively when that is unambiguous (Windows folder names are
case-insensitive). The workspace is the repo folder's parent, since a repo is always a direct
child of its workspace.

The command runs through a shell (so `.cmd`/`.ps1` work), with `PLAYGROUND_WORKTREE_PATH`,
`PLAYGROUND_REPO_PATH` and `PLAYGROUND_BRANCH` in its environment, and is killed after 120 s.
A malformed or blank value is ignored (no hook runs). Note that a repo-declared command is repo
content: cloning an untrusted repo into a registered workspace means its `postCreateCommand`
runs on your next worktree create for that repo — the workspace-level declaration does not carry
that risk, since you author it yourself.

## Stack

- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) + [React 19](https://react.dev/) + TypeScript, scaffolded with [electron-vite](https://electron-vite.org/)
- [node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty) PTYs (main process) + [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) (renderer), bridged by typed streaming IPC
- A single typed IPC contract (`src/shared/ipc-contract.ts`) is the spine between main / preload / renderer
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for behavior-level tests (real git / FS in temp dirs; hand-rolled fakes, no mocking library)
- JSON config persisted to `%APPDATA%/playground/config.json` — no database

> Windows-only. The only thing the app writes to Azure DevOps or GitHub is a pull-request comment:
> a reply, a thread's state (Azure DevOps' statuses, GitHub's resolve / reopen), a new thread from
> a selection, or a general comment — each the direct result of a click or Ctrl+Enter. Nothing is
> written in the background.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # start the app with HMR
npm test           # vitest run
npm run typecheck  # type-check main + renderer
npm run lint       # eslint
npm run format     # prettier
npm run build:win  # production build + Windows installer
```

Pre-PR gate: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test`.

## Diagnostics

When the app slows down, an opt-in log records what main is doing. Set `PLAYGROUND_DEBUG_PERF=1` before
the app starts; any other value, or none, leaves it off and costs nothing. To turn it on for one launch,
set the variable in a terminal and start the app from that same terminal:

```powershell
$env:PLAYGROUND_DEBUG_PERF = '1'
npm run dev   # or start the installed playground.exe from this terminal
```

With it on, the app appends one JSON line a minute to `perf-diagnostics.jsonl` in its user data folder,
next to `config.json`: main's event-loop delay, git processes by subcommand and worktree, terminal output
and scrollback append time per session, worktree recounts and status events, and session-name listings.
Worktrees appear by folder name only; no full path, no git argument beyond the subcommand and no
terminal content is written. The same switch also prints a `[perf] loop` line to the console every 10 s.
The file grows across launches until you delete it.

For developers, `node scripts/bench-sessions.mjs` runs the built app with N fake sessions and prints
these figures against the performance targets (`npx electron-vite build` first).
