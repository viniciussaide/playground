 * ctx is what makes the hook non-optional — no call site can bypass it.
 *
 * The hook runs **iff the create actually produced a worktree**: `ok` with a
 * `path`. That single test covers every no-worktree outcome without enumerating
 * them (WPC-08) — a branch-exists conflict, an empty rendered template, an
 * existing target path, a blocked base refresh and a failed `git worktree add`
 * are all `ok: false` — while the successful `reuse`/`recreate` paths are
 * `ok: true` with a path and so do run it.
 *
 * A repo that declares no command is returned untouched, with **no `hook` key at
 * all**, keeping the pre-feature result shape byte-identical (WPC-06). A hook
 * that fails never invalidates the create: `ok` and `path` pass through and the
 * failure rides along in `hook` (WPC-03) — nothing here removes a worktree.
 *
 * `onStep` goes to the create as is, and hears `running-hook` right before the
 * command runs, so only when one runs (CRTO-13).
