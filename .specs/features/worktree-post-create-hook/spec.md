# Worktree Post-Create Hook Specification

## Problem Statement

A fresh `git worktree add` gives you a checkout, but not a _working_ checkout. Repos
increasingly need a one-shot local initialization step after the files land —
`m:\triade\source\Code` ships `SetupSkills.cmd` (→ `SetupSkills.ps1`) whose only job is to
create the `.claude\skills` and `.codex\skills` junctions that let multiple coding agents
share one skills source. Today that script has to be remembered and double-clicked by hand
in every new worktree, and worktrees created by a **workflow** (for an agent to work in)
never get it at all — which is precisely the case that needs it most.

## Goals

- [ ] A repo can declare one shell command that runs automatically, with cwd = the new
      worktree, after every successful worktree create — from any of the app's three create
      paths.
- [ ] A failing init command never costs the user the worktree: the checkout is kept and the
      failure is reported with its exit code and output, not swallowed.
- [ ] Zero behavior change for repos that declare nothing.

| Multiple commands / ordered hook list                          | One command is enough — a repo that needs several chains them in its own `.cmd`/`.ps1`, exactly as `SetupSkills.cmd` already calls `SetupSkills.ps1`.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Other lifecycle hooks (pre-create, post-remove, post-checkout) | Only the post-create pain is real today. Adding a hook registry now would design for hooks nobody has asked for.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Settings-dialog UI for the command                             | The command is repo-local and checked in (AD decision below); there is nothing per-machine to edit. A global override can be layered later if needed.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Trust prompt / command allowlist                               | Deliberate: see the security assumption below. The set of repos in a registered workspace is already fully trusted by the app (it runs `git` in them).                                                                                                                                                        |
| Process-tree kill on timeout                                   | The timeout kills the spawned shell; a detached grandchild may survive. A real tree-kill (`taskkill /T /F`) is a separate, Windows-specific concern. **Note:** a surviving grandchild no longer delays the result — the shell settles on `exit` + a flush grace period, not on `close` (see `hook-shell.ts`). |
| Streaming live output into a terminal session                  | Considered and rejected during Specify — needs session lifecycle plumbing and severs the create's knowledge of whether init succeeded.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Re-run / retry action for a failed hook                        | The command is idempotent by convention (the reference script is) and re-runnable by hand from the worktree. An in-app re-run button is a v2 nicety.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Reading the hook command from the **new worktree's** copy      | The source repo's `.app/config.json` is authoritative — reading the worktree's own copy would let a branch under development change what runs on checkout.                                                                                                                                                    |

## User Stories

### P1: Repo-declared init command runs after create ⭐ MVP

**User Story**: As a developer, I want a command my repo declares to run automatically in
each new worktree, so that a fresh worktree is immediately usable (skills junctions in
place) without me remembering to double-click a script.

**Why P1**: This is the entire feature. Without it there is nothing to report on and nothing
to render.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **WPC-01** — WHEN `createWorktree` completes a `git worktree add` successfully AND
   `<repoPath>\.app\config.json` contains a non-blank string `postCreateCommand` THEN the
   system SHALL execute that command through a shell with `cwd` set to the created worktree
   path, before returning.
2. **WPC-02** — WHEN the command exits with code `0` THEN the result SHALL be
   `{ ok: true, path: <worktree>, hook: { ok: true, command: <cmd>, code: 0, output: <tail> } }`.
3. **WPC-03** — WHEN the command exits with a non-zero code `N` THEN the result SHALL be
   `{ ok: true, path: <worktree>, hook: { ok: false, command: <cmd>, code: N, output: <tail> } }`
   AND the worktree directory SHALL still exist on disk (no rollback, no `worktree remove`).
4. **WPC-04** — WHEN the command cannot be spawned at all (shell-level spawn error) THEN the
   result SHALL carry `hook: { ok: false, code: -1, … }` with the error text included in
   `output`, and the worktree SHALL still exist.
5. **WPC-05** — WHEN the command has not exited within **120000 ms** THEN the system SHALL
   terminate the spawned shell process and return
   `hook: { ok: false, code: -1, timedOut: true, output: <tail captured so far> }`, and the
   worktree SHALL still exist.
6. **WPC-06** — WHEN `<repoPath>\.app\config.json` is absent, unreadable, malformed JSON, or
   its `postCreateCommand` is missing / blank / whitespace-only / not a string THEN NO command
   SHALL be executed AND the returned result SHALL have **no `hook` property** (identical to
   the pre-feature result shape).
7. **WPC-07** — WHEN `<repoPath>\.app\config.json` is malformed JSON THEN the system SHALL log
   the ignored file via `console.error` and fall back silently (same stance as
   `workspaceTemplates`).
8. **WPC-08** — WHEN a create ends **without** a new worktree — `conflict: 'branch-exists'`,
   an empty rendered template name, a pre-existing target path, a blocked base refresh, a
   branch live in another worktree, or any failed `git worktree add` — THEN NO command SHALL
   be executed. WHEN a create **does** produce a worktree via the `onExisting: 'reuse'` or
   `onExisting: 'recreate'` paths THEN the command SHALL run exactly as on the normal path.
9. **WPC-09** — WHEN the command is executed THEN its environment SHALL be the inherited
   `process.env` plus `PLAYGROUND_WORKTREE_PATH` (created worktree path),
   `PLAYGROUND_REPO_PATH` (source repo path), and `PLAYGROUND_BRANCH` (the branch name).
10. **WPC-10** — WHEN a worktree is created through **any** of the three paths
    (`worktrees:create` IPC from New Worktree, the same IPC from Start Work, and workflow
    `ctx.worktree.create`) THEN the hook SHALL run, because it is executed inside
    `createWorktree` itself and no caller can opt out.
11. **WPC-11** — WHEN the command's captured combined output exceeds 4000 characters THEN
    `hook.output` SHALL contain the **last** 4000 characters.

**Independent Test**: In a temp repo with `.app\config.json` declaring a command that writes
a marker file, call `createWorktree` and assert (a) the marker exists inside the new worktree,
(b) `hook.ok === true`, `hook.code === 0`. Swap in a command that exits 1 and assert
`ok === true`, `hook.ok === false`, `hook.code === 1`, worktree still present.

### P1: Hook failure is visible where the user created the worktree ⭐ MVP

**User Story**: As a developer, I want a failed init command reported in the dialog I just
used, so that I know the worktree exists but is not fully set up — instead of discovering
missing junctions later.

**Why P1**: Per the failure decision the create returns `ok: true`; without this the failure
is silently discarded by both dialogs and the feature is undetectable in the UI.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **WPC-12** — WHEN `worktrees:create` returns `hook.ok === false` from the **New Worktree**
   dialog THEN the dialog SHALL remain open and display: a confirmation that the worktree was
   created (with its path), the executed command, the exit code (or a timeout label), and the
   `hook.output` tail.
2. **WPC-13** — WHEN `worktrees:create` returns `hook.ok === false` from the **Start Work**
   dialog THEN the dialog SHALL remain open and display the same four elements as WPC-12.
3. **WPC-14** — WHEN a hook-failure state is shown THEN the dialog SHALL offer an action that
   dismisses it and proceeds with the normal post-create flow (tree refresh + select the new
   worktree) — the created worktree is never stranded behind an error the user must undo.
4. **WPC-15** — WHEN the result has `hook.ok === true` OR no `hook` property THEN both dialogs
   SHALL behave exactly as they do today (close, refresh the tree, select the new worktree)
   with no additional UI.
5. **WPC-16** — WHEN a hook-failure state is shown THEN the create button SHALL NOT re-submit
   the same create (the worktree already exists; a re-submit would fail on the target-path
   guard).

**Independent Test**: With a repo whose `postCreateCommand` is `exit /b 1`, create a worktree
from each dialog and confirm the failure panel shows command + exit code + output, the
worktree appears in the tree after dismissing, and no error is shown for a repo with no
`.app\config.json`.

### P2: Hook result on the workflow run timeline

**User Story**: As a workflow author, I want a worktree step's init result shown in the run
timeline, so that a failed init in an unattended run is visible without reading the
workflow's own logging.

**Why P2**: Needs a new shared `StepDetail` variant plus a `RunDetail` render branch. Until
then a workflow author can already read `result.hook` from `ctx.worktree.create` and
`ctx.log`/`ctx.notify` it — so the information is reachable, just not automatic.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **WPC-17** — WHEN a `ctx.worktree.create` step's result carries a `hook` THEN the
   `step-finished` event SHALL carry a `detail` describing it (command, ok, code, output tail).
2. **WPC-18** — WHEN a `ctx.worktree.create` step's hook failed THEN the step SHALL still be
   reported `ok: true` (a hook failure is not a step failure — consistent with WPC-03).
3. **WPC-19** — WHEN a run's `worktree.create` step carries a hook detail THEN `RunDetail`
   SHALL render it in the step's detail box, visually marked as failed when `ok` is false.

## Edge Cases

- **WPC-20** — WHEN the created worktree path contains spaces THEN the command SHALL still run
  correctly (the path is passed as the spawn `cwd`, never interpolated into the command string).
- **WPC-21** — WHEN `<repoPath>\.app\config.json` contains `postCreateCommand` alongside
  `branchTemplate`/`worktreeTemplate` keys THEN each reader SHALL ignore the other's keys — the
  hook reader never affects template resolution and vice versa.
- **WPC-22** — WHEN two creates run concurrently (e.g. a workflow run plus a manual create)
  THEN each hook SHALL execute independently with its own cwd and captured output; neither
  shares state with nor blocks the other.
- **WPC-23** — WHEN the command produces no output at all THEN `hook.output` SHALL be the empty
  string (never `undefined`), so consumers need no absent-vs-empty branch.
- **WPC-24** — WHEN the command exits 0 but the worktree is still not properly initialized
  (script silently did nothing) THEN the system SHALL report success — the exit code is the only
  contract; the app does not verify the script's intent.

## Implicit-Requirement Dimensions Sweep

Medium scope — dimensions obviously present for this domain are covered; the rest are
explicitly N/A.

| Dimension                        | Resolution                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Input validation & bounds        | WPC-06 (blank / non-string / malformed), WPC-05 (time bound), WPC-11 (output bound)                                      |
| Failure / partial-failure states | WPC-03, WPC-04, WPC-05 — every failure mode keeps the worktree and reports; WPC-08 defines "no worktree"                 |
| Observability                    | WPC-07 (`console.error` on malformed config), WPC-12/13 (surfaced to the user), WPC-17 (run timeline)                    |
| Concurrency / ordering           | WPC-22 (independent), and the hook is strictly ordered after `git worktree add`, before the return                       |
| State-transition integrity       | WPC-08 — hook runs **iff** a worktree was actually created                                                               |
| Idempotency / retry              | No automatic retry; the hook runs at most once per successful create. Re-running is manual (Out of Scope)                |
| Auth boundaries & rate limits    | N/A because the command runs in-process on the user's own machine at their own request; no remote caller                 |
| External-dependency failure      | N/A because the hook makes no network or service call — the spawned process is the only dependency, covered by WPC-04/05 |
| Data lifecycle / expiry          | N/A because the hook persists nothing — the captured output lives only in the returned result                            |

## Requirement Traceability

**Status after execution:** the 21 P1 requirements are **Verified** — T1–T6 plus fix commits
F1–F4, independently validated by a fresh Verifier (round 2 PASS, all four round-1 findings
closed; see `validation.md`). WPC-17..19 stay **Pending** as the deliberately deferred P2 slice.

**ID format:** `WPC-[NUMBER]`

**Coverage:** 24 total — 21 in the P1 MVP slice (WPC-01..16, WPC-20..24), 3 deferred to P2
(WPC-17..19).

† **Built, not visually confirmed.** WPC-12..16 are renderer ACs: implemented, typechecked and
built, with the data path verified by inspection — but the renderer carries no unit tests by
project convention (`TESTING.md`), and **no visual/UAT pass has been run**. They become
_Verified_ only after the owner's visual gate. The same applies to the spec's Success Criteria,
which remain unconfirmed on real hardware.

**Unit-testable vs hand-verified** (per `.specs/codebase/TESTING.md`): WPC-01..11 and
WPC-20..24 are main-process logic → **unit tests** (real-temp-dir + injected-fake runner for the
decision logic). The shell seam is the one deviation from the original plan: it was to be a
hand-verified thin shell inside `index.ts`, but the Verifier proved its settle condition wrong
in a way no fake could catch, so it now lives in `src/main/hook-shell.ts` with **real-process
tests** (`hook-shell.test.ts`). WPC-12..16 are renderer → built + inspected, visual pass
outstanding (see †).

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Creating a worktree for `m:\triade\source\Code` (with `.app\config.json` declaring
      `SetupSkills.cmd`) leaves `.claude\skills` and `.codex\skills` junctions present in the
      new worktree, with no manual step.
- [ ] A worktree created by a **workflow** for that repo gets the same junctions.
- [ ] A repo with no `.app\config.json` behaves byte-identically to today (existing
      `worktree-manager` tests pass unchanged).
- [ ] A deliberately-failing command yields a worktree that exists, plus a dialog showing the
      command, its exit code, and its output.
