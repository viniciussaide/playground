 * A zone: an empty view zone that opens the gap, and the overlay drawn over it
 * that the content is portaled into (`MountedZone`).
 *
 * The overlay follows the gap: Monaco reports the gap's top on every render,
 * scrolling included, and whether it draws the gap at all. A gap it does not
 * draw (scrolled far off, or inside a folded region) hides the overlay, which
 * shows again when the gap does (#130). A gap under the last line before a
 * folded region is drawn, as that line is.
 *
 * The gap's height follows the content's: a thread that expands, or a composer
 * that grows, pushes the lines below it down. A hidden overlay keeps its
 * layout, so its content is measured even while Monaco draws no gap.
