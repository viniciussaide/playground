## Confirmed (load these at Specify/Design)

Corroborated across multiple features. Safe to apply as guidance.

### L-001 - When a design types a cross-phase dependency as required, wire the producer and consumer in one phase (or gate the field) rather than relaxing it to optional to keep an interim phase's typecheck green
- signal: `spec_deviation` · recurrence: 2 feature(s) · scope: `workflow-ctx` · harmful: 0
- features: workflows-agent-step, workflows-blocker-resume
- evidence: src/main/workflow-ctx.ts:82,106 (CtxDeps.agent / CtxRuntime.signal SPEC_DEVIATION) (workflow-ctx) (+1 more)
- last seen: 2026-07-06T16:15:40Z

### L-005 - Before adding real-process or real-git tests, check whether existing suites already sit near the default per-test timeout: the extra parallel load alone can push them over it, turning a green gate red without any production change
- signal: `gate_fail` · recurrence: 2 feature(s) · scope: `testing` · harmful: 0
- features: worktree-post-create-hook, worktree-removal-fault-tolerance
- evidence: validation.md round-2 gate section; tree.test.ts / worktree-manager.test.ts timeouts (testing) (+1 more)

## Candidates (under observation - do NOT load as guidance yet)

Seen once or not yet corroborated. Tracked, not trusted.

### L-008 - When a hard-coded value becomes a lookup table keyed by an existing enum, test the wiring from key to entry, not just the table: asserting the table's contents leaves the new key free to silently resolve to the old entry, and a guard that returns before any side effect (a missing-path check) usually makes that routing assertable without touching the real subsystem.

- last seen: 2026-08-28T19:48:01Z

### L-009 - A default-constant test that asserts resolvePaneWidth(undefined, bounds, DEFAULT) against DEFAULT itself cannot detect a change to that constant — pin every spec-derived default with a literal assertion, not a self-referential one.
- signal: `surviving_mutant` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `renderer/lib` · harmful: 0
- features: sidebar-resize-collapse
- evidence: src/renderer/src/lib/pane-layout.test.ts:41 (renderer/lib)
- last seen: 2026-08-31T22:35:36Z

### L-010 - When a spec edge case says 'empty/whitespace', guard with trim().length > 0, not length > 0, or whitespace-only selections slip past the empty check.
- signal: `spec_precision_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `src/renderer/src/components` · harmful: 0
- features: terminal-input-fixes
- evidence: src/renderer/src/components/TerminalPane.tsx:95 (src/renderer/src/components)
- last seen: 2026-09-01T00:11:37Z

### L-011 - When an AC names a literal byte or string the app must emit, export that literal as a const from the tested lib seam and assert it (plus assert it is NOT the wrong value) - a literal inlined in an untested component leaves a NOT-SHALL-send AC unguarded and a byte flip passes the whole suite.
- signal: `surviving_mutant` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `src/renderer/src/lib,src/renderer/src/components` · harmful: 0
- features: terminal-copy-undo-fixes
- evidence: M11 TerminalPane.tsx:134 (src/renderer/src/lib,src/renderer/src/components)
- last seen: 2026-09-09T21:51:27Z

### L-012 - Under a no-component-tests convention, push every AC-bearing decision (timestamp restart, trim threshold, preventDefault ordering) into the pure lib function and leave only DOM/clipboard calls in the component - state left in the component is verifiable by reading only and regresses silently.
- signal: `surviving_mutant` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `src/renderer/src/components` · harmful: 0
- features: terminal-copy-undo-fixes

- last seen: 2026-09-09T21:51:28Z

### L-013 - An AC that starts a timer 'WHEN the app copies X' must state explicitly whether an attempted copy of nothing also starts it - the implementation set the timestamp before the empty-selection guard, a behavior no AC covers and no test can flag.
- signal: `spec_precision_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `.specs/features` · harmful: 0
- features: terminal-copy-undo-fixes
- evidence: TCU-05 vs TCU-19 (.specs/features)
- last seen: 2026-09-09T21:51:28Z

### L-014 - Freeze a design region by naming the components that are unchanged, never by a CSS or source line range, because a line range silently over-freezes neighbouring rules the handoff re-specified.
- signal: `spec_precision_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `design` · harmful: 0
- features: agents-rail-v2

- last seen: 2026-09-13T16:04:58Z

### L-015 - When one acceptance criterion refers to a label another criterion already pins, cite that criterion instead of paraphrasing it, because a paraphrase drifts and the two criteria then disagree.
- signal: `spec_precision_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `spec` · harmful: 0

- evidence: spec.md RAIL-19 vs RAIL-09 (validation.md SP-1) (spec)
- last seen: 2026-09-13T16:04:59Z

### L-016 - Do not type a clickable row that contains its own action buttons as a <button>; use a div with role="option" plus tabIndex and key handling, because a button nested in a button is invalid HTML.
- signal: `spec_deviation` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `renderer` · harmful: 0

- evidence: src/renderer/src/components/SessionRail.tsx:264 SPEC_DEVIATION (renderer)
- last seen: 2026-09-13T16:05:00Z

### L-017 - Assert a reset-to-zero effect from a state that actually holds a non-zero value: a test that drives the event from an already-zero state passes whether or not the reset happens
- signal: `surviving_mutant` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `testing` · harmful: 0
- features: session-activity-status
- evidence: activity-machine.ts:77,:108 (testing)
- last seen: 2026-09-16T00:25:09Z

### L-018 - When an AC lands in a layer the project exempts from unit tests, extract the decision into a lib module and test that, rather than deferring the evidence to a smoke script that has not been written yet
- signal: `ac_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `renderer` · harmful: 0
- features: session-activity-status
- evidence: ACTV-07, ACTV-27 (renderer)
- last seen: 2026-09-16T00:25:09Z

### L-019 - Pin a spec-mandated numeric limit with a literal assertion on the default production uses; a test that overrides the value to run fast leaves the default free to drift.
- signal: `surviving_mutant` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `src/main/**` · harmful: 0

- last seen: 2026-09-19T16:44:45Z

### L-020 - When an AC mandates an environment variable or spawn option for a child process, assert it from inside the spawned process or on the spawn call; testing the wrapper's outcomes never observes it.

- last seen: 2026-09-19T16:44:45Z

### L-021 - When a task names a smoke script as the sole evidence for an AC, confirm the script has a numbered check asserting that AC before marking it done; listing the requirement ID is not a check.
- signal: `ac_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `scripts/smoke` · harmful: 0
- features: status-bar
- evidence: STBR-23 / M19 src/renderer/src/components/SyncPopover.tsx:94; tasks.md T18 claims sole evidence (scripts/smoke)

### L-022 - Before an edge case cites a state the app already derives, confirm the model carries it at that level; otherwise name the state the feature must add.
- signal: `spec_precision_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `spec` · harmful: 0
- features: status-bar
- evidence: spec.md Edge Cases: path-missing state the tree already derives (only WorkspaceNode.missing exists) (spec)
- last seen: 2026-09-19T16:44:45Z

### L-023 - Git pull and push write progress and hint lines to stderr before the error, so report the first fatal or error line rather than the first stderr line.
- signal: `spec_deviation` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `src/main/**` · harmful: 0
- features: status-bar
- evidence: src/main/git-sync.ts:69-80 errorLine vs gitFailureLine (src/main/**)
- last seen: 2026-09-19T16:44:46Z

### L-024 - When an error extractor accepts several prefixes, drive a real failure for each prefix; testing only one leaves the others, and flags that turn the refusal into success, free to change unseen.
- signal: `surviving_mutant` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `main/git` · harmful: 0
- features: status-bar

- last seen: 2026-09-19T17:53:18Z

### L-025 - Map every spec edge case to its own test or numbered smoke check in tasks.md, as ACs are; edge cases left to structure or to the tool's own behaviour reach validation with no evidence.
- signal: `ac_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `specs/edge-cases` · harmful: 0

- evidence: validation.md edge cases: dirty pull, Escape, one popover at a time, no toast; STBR-25 refresh (specs/edge-cases)
- last seen: 2026-09-19T17:53:18Z

### L-026 - When a spec names a git command, name the flags that keep its behaviour independent of user and system git config such as pull.rebase, and pin that config in the real-git tests.
- signal: `spec_precision_gap` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `git, main-process` · harmful: 0

### L-027 - A rejection fixture must reach the guard it claims to test: a wrong-shape input that is also the wrong length dies on the length check, leaving the real guard unproven.

- last seen: 2026-09-20T22:58:11Z

### L-028 - When an AC says 'more than N', seed a fixture at exactly N: counts above and below it cannot tell > from >=.
- signal: `surviving_mutant` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `tests/boundaries` · harmful: 0
- features: files-commits
- evidence: validation.md M5 (src/main/commit-log.ts:82) (tests/boundaries)
- last seen: 2026-09-20T22:58:11Z

### L-029 - Promise.all returns on the first rejection and abandons its siblings still running; on Windows a child holding a temp directory as its cwd then blocks its removal, so use allSettled when every branch spawns a process.
- signal: `gate_fail` · recurrence: 1 feature(s) · scope: `src/main/**, windows` · harmful: 0

### L-030 - Every acceptance criterion left to hand-verification must appear as a named line in the owner smoke script's hand-verify header or as a smoke check
