/**
 * The real `HookShell` (WPC-01): runs a repo's post-create command **through a
 * shell**, so a checked-in `.cmd`/`.ps1` works, in the new worktree with the
 * `PLAYGROUND_*` env the caller supplies. Never throws — a spawn error becomes
 * `code: -1` rather than a rejection.
 *
 * **Settling is deliberately not just `close`.** The timeout is `spawn`'s own: on
 * expiry Node signals the shell, and a non-null `signal` is the only reliable
 * "killed for time" marker (an exit code alone is ambiguous on Windows). But
 * `close` waits for every inherited pipe to reach EOF, and killing `cmd.exe` does
 * NOT kill its children — a surviving grandchild holds those pipes open, so `close`
 * can lag the kill by many seconds or never arrive at all. Waiting on it alone
 * would leave `worktrees:create` unresolved and the caller stuck.
 *
 * So whichever comes first wins: `close` (complete output, the normal case) or
 * `exit` plus a short flush grace period (progress even when `close` is hostage to
 * a grandchild). Either way the result is returned promptly. A detached grandchild
 * may still outlive the shell — that limitation stands (a real process-tree kill is
 * out of scope) — but it can no longer hold the create hostage.
 *
 * The grace timer is deliberately **not** `unref`'d: it must be able to keep the
 * event loop alive on its own for those few milliseconds, or the `exit` path would
 * only appear to guarantee progress while actually depending on `close`/the open
 * pipes to keep the process running.
 *
 * Output completeness is unaffected. A process cannot exit until its writes have
 * been accepted, so at most a pipe-buffer's worth is in flight at `exit`, and
 * `close` wins that race — measured complete for a 1 MB single burst.
